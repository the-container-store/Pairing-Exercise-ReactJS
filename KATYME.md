# My notes

## My approach
I'm more comfortable with styling, so I left that to the end. With each summary being a very large object with objects as values and values in one array needing to pair up with keys in another, I wanted to tackle that first because that would be my weakest part. I came up with the terms dizzy data or object disoriented flatlining to inject humour into something that became very frustrating.

I also wanted to treat this more like a test than an in-class assignment. Normally, I'd as for help and not dwell, but this (to me) had to reflect my understanding and approach. I tried to leave my comments in to communicate to you, not to junk it up.


I found myself in a pickle when I was getting NaN when I dealt with more users. One user is ok. > one led to NaN. Logging in the console from the storageCalculator gave me numbers, but in the component where I was actually calling the functions, I got a NaN.
I did not know what I should do:
- just do one shelving calculation and not move on until I fixed that
- let it go and see if dealing with different issues (drawers and shoes) made a difference.

Sadly, I went with the latter. I came to the conclusion to late to change that I shouldn't be passing the user as an argument. I think. Still not sold on that, but I do believe handling the multiple users is where I'm going wrong. 

Because of this, I returned null when there were more than one so I could switch to styling. I also didn't get to the hanging section mostly because I could not approach it even with one user, I got tired of seeing NaN, and I wanted to be mindful of the allotted time for this.

## What I learned
So much. Tackling the objects to get what I needed out of them was probably the most fun I had not being successful in a long time. It felt like the New York Times Saturday puzzle. 
I do hope to still be able to talk about what I tried and where I went astray because even though I did not succeed on this challenge, I want to know where I went wrong. Although I'm going to add/commit and submit a PR, the problem will stay in my head. I want to know!

Thank you for understanding that life got in the way last week.
